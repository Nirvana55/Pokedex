//need to search card when press enter and search btn
//need to animate the pokeball behind
//need to create sound

//when the user search the card should be dipslayed
//either it should be display there is no card

//to do that we need to search tHROUGH API elements

//my logic is to fetch those values and store it to an array and whenever the user search it will search through array not the elements

//but can we fetch directly through the API???
